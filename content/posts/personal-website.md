A personal portfolio website is something that I've been meaning to have for a while now... and it's finally here! 

So for this first post I thought why not talk about my experience setting this up and maybe help someone else that is in the same boat as me (not a web developer), but wants to have a personal, portfolio, resume and/or blogging website.
