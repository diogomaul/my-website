A personal website is something that I've been meaning to have for a while now... and it's finally here! 

So for this first post I thought why not talk about my experience setting this up and maybe help someone else that is in the same boat as me (not a web developer), but wants to have a personal, portfolio, resume or blogging website.

Let's go then:

As any "not a web developer" person, I started looking for HTML templates and other things like this. After testing 2 or 3 alternatives, I really liked how this HUGO framework works. It basically provides you with the website strucuture and you just need to create the sections (YAML files) that you want and go on from there adding the content and some customization.
